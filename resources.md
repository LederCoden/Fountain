What is gist?
-------------

[Gist](https://gist.github.com/) is way to share pieces of code, like pastebin, but with a full git backend.
This allows you to fork, diff and have multiple users edit a single snippet.


How do we contact it from our application?
------------------------------------------

In order to contact Gist and send it data, we use the Gist [api](http://developer.github.com/v3/gists/)
